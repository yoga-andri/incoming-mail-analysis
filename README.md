## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Volume Over Time
- **2021:** 998 letters  
- **2022:** 1,338 letters  
- **2023:** 1,312 letters  
🔎 There was a noticeable increase in letter volume from 2021 to 2022, followed by a **slight decline** in 2023. However, the total volume remains consistently high across the three years.

### 2. Letter Types
- **Top 4 Types:**  
  - Official Letter  
  - Invitation  
  - Internal Memo  
  - Memorandum  
🔎 The majority of incoming letters are **formal in nature**, indicating routine administrative communication between institutions.

### 3. Urgency Level
- Most of the incoming letters are categorized as Normal Urgency, showing that although various urgency levels exist, routine correspondence still makes up the majority.

### 4. Day Received
- **Monday** has the **highest** letter volume, while **Sunday** has the **lowest**.
- This suggests possible **accumulation during weekends** and administrative activities resuming at the start of the workweek.

### 5. Weekend Activity
- Although the official workweek is Monday to Friday, there are still **a few letters received on Saturday and Sunday**, indicating that **some agencies remain active** or operational during weekends.

### 6. Processing Delay
- Most letters are processed **on the same day or within 1 day** of receipt.
- A smaller portion experiences delays of 2 days or more, which might point to peak loads, resource constraints, or prioritization strategies.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Standardize urgency labeling to ensure consistent interpretation across departments, reducing the risk of misclassification and improving task prioritization.
- Optimize Monday workload handling, as data shows this day has the highest volume of incoming letters — likely due to weekend backlogs — by preparing resource allocation or scheduling in advance.
- Maintain fast processing standards, especially for time-sensitive letters, while also improving consistency in urgency tagging to enhance decision-making and operational flow.
